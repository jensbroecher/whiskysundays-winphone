<p>By using Whisky Sundays Services, you agree to these Conditions of Use. Please read them carefully.</p>
<p>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Whisky Sundays promotes the sale and delivery of alcohol beverages by duly licensed retail merchants. Alcohol beverages are a heavily-regulated commodity. Consequently, as a condition of accessing the Whisky Sundays Website and using the Whisky Sundays Services, you expressly and affirmatively acknowledge and agree to the following:</p>
<p>1.       Whisky Sundays DOES NOT SELL ALCOHOL BEVERAGES OR PROVIDE DELIVERY SERVICES, AND Whisky Sundays IS NOT A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER. ALL SALES AND DELIVERIES OF ALCOHOL BEVERAGES ARE MADE BY DULY LICENSED, PARTICIPATING RETAIL MERCHANTS.</p>
<p>2.       Whisky Sundays OFFERS INFORMATION AND A METHOD TO CONNECT DULY LICENSED, PARTICIPATING RETAIL MERCHANTS TO YOU AND OTHER LAWFUL CUSTOMERS SEEKING TO PURCHASE ALCOHOL BEVERAGES.</p>
<p>3.       Whisky Sundays HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY PARTICIPATING RETAIL MERCHANT, OR ANY COMMON CARRIER OR DELIVERY AGENT UTILIZED BY SAID MERCHANT, TO EFFECT THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS SOLD OR PROVIDED BY ANY PARTICIPATING RETAIL MERCHANTS TO YOU OR ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR OTHER THIRD PARTY.</p>
<p>4.       Whisky Sundays HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF YOU OR ANY CUSTOMER THAT MAY RESULT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FROM THE PURCHASE AND/OR CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL BEVERAGES PROMOTED BY OR ACQUIRED THROUGH THE Whisky Sundays SERVICE.</p>
<p>5.       YOU WILL NOT USE THE Whisky Sundays SERVICES UNLESS YOU ARE 18 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER, AND YOU WILL NOT FURNISH ALCOHOL BEVERAGES OBTAINED THROUGH THE Whisky Sundays SERVICE TO ANY PERSON WHO IS NOT A LAWFUL CONSUMER, i.e., SOMEONE WHO IS EITHER (i) UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE, OR (ii) OBVIOUSLY INTOXICATED, APPARENTLY INTOXICATED, OR KNOWN TO BE A HABITUAL DRUNKARD WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE LAWS GOVERNING THE STATE IN WHICH YOU RESIDE.</p>
<p>PRIVACY Please review our Privacy Notice, which also governs your use of Whisky Sundays Services, to understand our practices.</p>
<p>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS When you use any Whisky Sundays Service, or send e-mails to us, you are communicating with us electronically. You consent to receive communications from us electronically. We will communicate with you by e-mail, texting or by posting notices on this site or through the other Whisky Sundays Services. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.</p>
<p>LICENSE AND ACCESS Subject to your compliance with these Conditions of Use and your payment of any applicable fees, Whisky Sundays or its content providers grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable license to access and make personal and non-commercial use of the Whisky Sundays Services. This license does not include any resale or commercial use of any Whisky Sundays Service, or its contents; any collection and use of any product listings, descriptions, or prices associated with any good furnished or service; any derivative use of any Whisky Sundays Service or its contents. All rights not expressly granted to you in these Conditions of Use or other service terms issued by Whisky Sundays are reserved and retained by Whisky Sundays or its licensors, suppliers, publishers, rights holders, or other content providers. No Whisky Sundays Service, nor any part of any Whisky Sundays Service, may be reproduced, duplicated, copied, sold, resold, visited, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose without the express written consent of Whisky Sundays. You may not frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other proprietary information (including images, text, page layout, or form) of Whisky Sundays without Whisky Sundays's express written consent.</p>
<p>Equally important, all goods and services promoted by Whisky Sundays and sold by participating retail merchants must be purchased, received and consumed responsibly. You may not misuse the Whisky Sundays Services. You may use the Whisky Sundays Services only as permitted by law. This includes the following specific responsibilities:</p>
<p>·         You must be 18 year of age or older to use the Whisky Sundays Services, and you must be willing and able to certify that you are of legal age for the purpose of purchasing, receiving and consuming alcohol beverages;</p>
<p>·         You cannot furnish alcohol to minors or any other person prohibited by law from having or consuming alcohol beverage, i.e., anyone who is (i) under 18 years of age; (ii) visibly or obviously intoxicated at the time of delivery to you, or known by you to be a habitual drunkard; or (iii) otherwise legally ineligible to purchase or take possession of alcohol beverages;</p>
<p>·         You will provide identification upon delivery of any products purchased using the Whisky Sundays Services.</p>
<p>The licenses granted by Whisky Sundays terminate if you do not comply with these Conditions of Use or any other service terms issued by Whisky Sundays.</p>
<p>If the Customer does not provide sufficient and valid identification to the delivery agent upon delivery (or if the identification is deemed by driver in his/her sole discretion, the expertise of which is acknowledged, to be fraudulent, false, or sufficiently in question to warrant rejection) or if the identification provided does not match the name on the credit card used by the purchaser to pay for the order, the Customer agrees that s/he will forfeit the order and the cost of the order will be paid to the participating retail merchant and/or the common carrier in consideration for the time and effort required to prepare, package, and transport the order to the Customer and back to the retailer. In such a case of an unverified or unverifiable identification, the Customer will not be entitled to any refund or return.</p>
<p>PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS Whisky Sundays attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, Whisky Sundays does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any Whisky Sundays Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product promoted by Whisky Sundays itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition and on a timely basis in accordance with the return/refund policy.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY THE Whisky Sundays SERVICES AND ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) AND OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE Whisky Sundays SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY Whisky Sundays ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; AND &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. Whisky Sundays MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE Whisky Sundays SERVICES, OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE Whisky Sundays SERVICES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE Whisky Sundays SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.</p>
<p>ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Whisky Sundays Service, or to any products or services promoted through the Whisky Sundays Services, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</p>
<p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.</p>
<p>SITE POLICIES, MODIFICATION, AND SEVERABILITY Whisky Sundays reserves the right to make changes to our Website, policies, service terms, and these Conditions of Use at any time. If we modify these Conditions of Use, any such modifications will take effect proactively, upon your subsequent access to the Whisky Sundays Website. Please feel free to print out a copy of these Conditions of Use for your records. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.</p>
